Equation of Linear Regression is
Y = mX + b
(Also known as equation of slope)

- (Y) represents dependent variable
- (X) represents Independent variables
- (m) m is the slope of the line
- (b) is the intercept. (The value of Y when X is 0)

To Find:
m: we have     m = Sum of products of deviations / Sum of square deviations for X
b: we have     b = Mean of Y - (m * Mean of X)

Graphical Representation:
The graph of Linear Regression will always be Straight line or slope as the name suggest(linear).
It can be Inclining or declining both.

In real life we have data in scattered form. so some values may deviate from the straight line or fit, we call them Out liars or Errors.
