WHAT IS KNN?
K-Nearest Neaghbours (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance based machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
"intance-based" means it doesn't build an explicit model during training. Instead, it memorizes the entire training dataset and makes predictions based on similarity to stored examples.

WHAT TYPE OF ML MODEL IS IT?

Category               KNN
Learning Type       Supervised
Algorithm Type      Non-parametric, Lazy Learner
Task                Classification & Regression

Supervised: Needs labeled data (input + correct output).
Non-parametric: Doesn't assume a fixed form (e.g., no equation like linear regression).
Lazy Learner: No training phase — all computation happens at prediction time.

HOW KNN WORKS? (MAIN STEPS)

- Given a Data Point
- Calculate it's distance from all other data points in the data set.
- Get the closest K points
- For Regression: Get the average of their values.
- For Classification: Get the label with majority vote.
