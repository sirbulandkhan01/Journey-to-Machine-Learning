Hi, I’m Sirbuland Khan, a BS Electrical Engineering student specializing in Embedded Systems.
This repository documents my complete journey of learning Machine Learning — from fundamentals to advanced topics.

Here you will find:

A structured roadmap of all the topics I am covering

Code implementations for each concept

Short notes and explanations in every subdirectory

My personal understanding and reflections as I progress

I created this repository to track my growth, stay consistent, and help anyone who may be following a similar path.
Feel free to explore the folders and read the README files for detailed insights into each topic.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
